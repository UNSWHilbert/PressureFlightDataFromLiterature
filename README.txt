This GitHub page contains supporting material for the paper titled 'Validation of Fast Prediction Methods Against Hypersonic Flight Data.'
This paper will be presented at the 2024 Australasian Fluid Mechanics Conference.

In this paper the numerical predictions of 3 numerical tools is compared against flight data from the SHEFFEX 2 flight. While multiple papers have been published on this flight experiment the data that is presented in this paper mainly comes out of one of the following papers:


Guelhan, A., Siebe, F., Thiele, T.,Neeb, D.,Turner, J. and Ettl, J. 2012,  Instrumentation of the SHEFEX-II Flight Experiment and Selected Flight Data, in  18th AIAA/3AF International Space Planes and Hypersonic Systems and Technologies Conference.

Guelhan, A.,Neeb, D.,Thiele, T.,  Siebe, F, 2016, Aerothermal Postflight Analysis of the Sharp Edge Flight Experiment-II, Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, \bf 53, 153-177.

The data flight data and CAD information used in the AFMC paper is published on this GitHub page for others to use as well.  Two files are presented in this paper:


FlightData/PressureData.csv
CAD/SHEFFEXCAD.FCStd

The flight pressure data comes from figure 25 in their 2016 paper. 
The SHEFFEXCAD.FCStd is the FreeCAD (https://www.freecad.org/) file that holds the CAD information. The CAD folder also holds the STL and Step file that have been used in the numerical prediction tools.
